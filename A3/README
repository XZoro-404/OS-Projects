# Compile and Run instructions
To compile this program you run the following command on your linux machine.
'gcc main.c -lpthread' and to run the program you can run it with no delay with:
 './a.out -nodelay {# of vocalists} {# of composers} {# of soundproof rooms}'
 or with random delay delay:
 './a.out -randomdelay {# of vocalists} {# of composers} {# of soundproof rooms} {max wander time} {max room time}'

# Limitations
There are no known limitations to this program.

# Features
The features that are included in this program are:
2 different switches '-nodelay' and 'randomdelay'
nodelay: there is no delay on the wander time and the time spent in the sound room
randomdelay: takes input from what the max delay should be for the wander time and room time then gets a random number
                0 - user input for each wait time
This program will pair together composers and vocalists and they will go to a room when one is open.
